## Background

The database was created as part of the BIRD | Bildungsraum Digital research and development project. BIRD aims to create a digital infrastructure that enables various players in the educational landscape to efficiently network digital educational platforms.

In this context, this vocabulary database was developed for the education sector, which collects and structures existing controlled vocabularies and makes them accessible for reuse and subsequent utilisation.

This database is intended to facilitate communication between target groups and stakeholders and promote harmonising effects in the educational landscape, so that services can be made more interoperable and additional work in the development of vocabularies can be reduced by making them more visible and thus more likely to be reused.
