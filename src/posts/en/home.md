## Challenges in an educational landscape

When designing educational services, controlled vocabularies are often essential for capturing resources so that they become discoverable and reusable for various educational stakeholders. However, due to the multitude of different needs in a distributed educational landscape, reusable vocabularies for the education sector are not immediately accessible.

In an increasingly digital and networked educational landscape, various stakeholders face the challenge of making their services and platforms interoperable. Without standardized vocabularies, fragmented isolated solutions emerge, hindering data exchange and collaboration. The "[Compendium - Educational Metadata (en)](https://oellers.github.io/kompendium/)" (Oellers & Rörtgen 2025) has already highlighted the diversity of stakeholders and existing vocabularies. This database addresses the need for systematizing a market overview.

## Objectives of this Interactive Database

This database for controlled vocabularies in the education sector therefore plays a central role in the future standardization and harmonization of educational content.

The introduction of this database aims to:

- Collect, structure, and make existing controlled vocabularies accessible
- Facilitate communication between different target groups and stakeholders
- Promote harmonizing effects in the educational landscape
- Reduce additional efforts in vocabulary development
- Improve the interoperability of educational services
- Facilitate connectivity to national/international developments
- Simplify data exchange between different services

By increasing the visibility and reusability of vocabularies, our database provides a valuable resource for researching controlled vocabularies from national, European, and international educational projects.
